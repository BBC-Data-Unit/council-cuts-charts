In December 2018 we published [an article showing 7 ways in which cuts had changed council spending](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46443700). **Tom Calver** provided additional analysis and visualisation.

The cleaning, combination and analysis was largely done in R. You can find a number of notebooks and R scripts in this repo, with descriptions below.

## Get the data

* Most of the data was taken from the [Local authority revenue expenditure and financing collection](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-authority-revenue-expenditure-and-financing), going back to 2010-11
* Copies of the spreadsheets can be found in this repo, each beginning with 'Revenue_Outturn_Summary__RS__data'. The 2017/18 data is named [RS_2017-18_data_by_LA.xlsx](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/council-cuts-charts/blob/master/RS_2017-18_data_by_LA.xlsx)

## Quotes and interviews

## Analysis, scripts and notebooks

* The notebook [1downloadcleanaccounts.Rmd](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/council-cuts-charts/blob/master/1downloadcleanaccounts.Rmd) details the process of downloading, cleaning, and analysing council accounts.
* The notebook [1bcombineaccounts.Rmd](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/council-cuts-charts/blob/master/1bcombineaccounts.Rmd) details the process of combining the council accounts.
* The notebook [1ccombineaccounts_cbind.Rmd](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/council-cuts-charts/blob/master/1ccombineaccounts_cbind.Rmd) details the process of combining council accounts using `cbind`. This process was not used in the end, however, as using the uncombined accounts with `sqldf` (below) was a much simpler and more flexible approach
* The notebook [1ccombineaccounts_sqldf.Rmd](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/council-cuts-charts/blob/master/1ccombineaccounts_sqldf.Rmd) details the process of querying multiple council accounts to make comparisons.
* The notebook [2analyseaccountsDANamended.Rmd](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/council-cuts-charts/blob/master/2analyseaccountsDANamended.Rmd) outlines the process of analysing the accounts further
* The R function script [stripbackro.horiz.R](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/council-cuts-charts/blob/master/stripbackro.horiz.R) takes an Excel filename and a year, then returns a subset for main categories of spending with the year added as a prefix for the columns
* The R script [givemesqlquery.fromto.R](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/council-cuts-charts/blob/master/givemesqlquery.fromto.R) will, given a column name, and the names of 2 data frames, generate a SQL query that will generate 
#a table showing change from one data frame to another
